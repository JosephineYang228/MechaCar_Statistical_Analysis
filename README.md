### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
 - Vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle and AWD provided a non-random amout of varience.
 - Vehicle_length and ground_clearance had a random amout of varience.
### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 - No. The image above shows the p-value is much smaller than 0.05, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
 - Yes. The image above shows the Multiple R-squared value is 0.7149, which means that roughly 71.49% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (quarter-mile time predictions) is explained using this linear model.
